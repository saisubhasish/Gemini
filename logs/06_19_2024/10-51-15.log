* **Text:** Like other large language models (LLMs), Gemini can understand and generate text, translate languages, write different kinds of creative content, and answer your questions in an informative way.
* **Images:** Gemini can analyze and understand images, allowing it to describe what's in an image, identify objects, and even create images from text prompts.
* **Videos:** Gemini can process and understand videos, potentially allowing it to summarize videos, extract information, and even generate new video content.
* **Audio:** Gemini is expected to be able to understand and generate audio, enabling features like speech recognition, text-to-speech, and potentially even creating original music.

**Here's what makes Gemini special:**

* **Multimodality:** This is the key feature that differentiates Gemini from previous Google models like Bard. It can seamlessly interact with multiple forms of information, making it more versatile and capable.
* **Advanced capabilities:** Google claims Gemini will be able to perform more complex tasks than previous AI models, including reasoning, planning, and problem-solving.
* **Safety and alignment:** Google emphasizes that Gemini will be built with strong safety and alignment mechanisms to ensure it is used responsibly.

**However, Gemini is still in development:**

* **Limited public access:**  Currently, Gemini is not available for public use. 
* **Early stages:** While Google has shared some details and demos, much of Gemini's capabilities are still being developed and refined.

**Overall, Gemini is poised to be a significant advancement in AI technology, with the potential to revolutionize how we interact with information and technology. We are likely to see its capabilities expand and its applications become more widespread in the coming years.**
